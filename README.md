I have added 2 buttons to the navbar, users, and logout. Users were added so you can allways return to /users without using browser navigation, and logout was used because the only way i could prevent forceful routing was by keeping a state of loggedIn saved in localStorage. Other loggin functionalities are present. I have tried to the best of my ability to handle potential fetch errors since that area requires more work from my side. If they are not satisfactory i will do my best to learn them in the timeframe remaining.
Successful fetch should redirect to users page as requested while failed one should display alert notification.
